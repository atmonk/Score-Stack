# Score Stack

Score Stack is a personal project created for a quick way to keep score of your gruelling matches of Dutch Blitz. Ditch the napkin and pen!

## Roadmap

I'm currently using a Google Sheet everytime I play Dutch Blitz, but wouldn't it be more user friendly, nicer to look at, and have less room for error if this boring sheet were a web app? My goal is to create a functional web app to be accessed on desktop or mobile for matches at home or at the brewery.

## Project status

I'm just getting started, hold your critism please!
